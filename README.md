# GoScrapy-cli

With this cli app we can get data of sold products from some web pages, and save it in two formats:
 - JSON
 - CSV

Mainly we pretend to help and make easy use of that info for other apps that can consume data in these's formats.

You can add the necessary data into the cli for making that task in two different ways, you can use flags or configure files.
